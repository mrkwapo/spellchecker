Using a server I created I will be creating a spell checker.

Challange:
Download data from the above link using one of the files. 
And create a spellchecker api that when sent with a query from a browser such as ?word=apple, 
check weather the word apple is in the dictionary and should respond back saying it's correct or not  


Whiteboard:
Use file containing all the words to be used as a dictionary.

find a method to read the file

create a way to use the users search term and 

use a method to search the file for the search term.

create a condition that tells the user if the word exists or not
